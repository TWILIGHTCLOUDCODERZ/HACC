In this project we are solving legislative tracker issues using LC/NC platform -Microsoft powerapps, docusign, Forms, sharepoint

## ISSUE:-
lEGISLATIVE TRACKER SOLUTION USING LC/NC FEATURE
This LTS is critical, as it assists the Department with:
● Obtaining real time information on the status of legislative measures
● Notifying offices that their assigned bills and resolutions are scheduled for hearings
● Managing testimony workflows
● Reporting on education-related measures and measures affecting the Department

## SOLUTION:-

Using modern app we are solving the problem when the senator or house of department approaches the bill to get funding for society each important department team as well manager/director/PIPE/HOD will receive bill form in pdf format which will be reviewed and all manadtory doc in place upon approval and sign bill processed for fund sanctioning financial team and bill saved in share point for feature review and proof of security track. 

## TOOLS:-
● Microsoft Forms- initial page for senator/house of deppart can submit bill for funds ( can be used webapps/ andriod /ios app)
● Microsoft Sharepoint- for backend data store bill once approved and signed by all leaders stored in sharepoint  for feature review and proof of security track.( Any DB can be used like Mongo/SQL/Azure datalake storegae/cosmo db instead of sharepoint)
● Docusign - bill process flow to each leader department wise (Abode can also be used as  bill form)
● Microsoft Powerapps - Automatic flow which ease workflow function avoids FTP/SMTP requirement.
